		-Starting Weight
		-Goal Weight
		-Heaviest exercise stats
		-Favourite exercise stats
		-Table of exercises from the latest workout day.

		bottom to design a custom workout routine.
	-Clicking a routine should show your latest stats for each exercise in the routine.
	-Each exercise should be editable to track progress. If the date during edit is more recent
		than the last record, it will create a new document in the DB. Otherwise, it should update
		the values of that exercise if it is on the same day.
-Workout Routine Templates
	-Shows some default workout routines that users can follow if they do not have one.

-Graphs* 
	-Future feature. Not included in MVC.
